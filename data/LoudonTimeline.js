The generally well-reviewed play, by Marc Alan Zagoren, closed during its Chicago tryout, perhaps because of a horrible bit of timing: the real Princess Grace died in a car accident the day after the opening.",

Loudon never broke the curse of the cinema: Carol Burnett played Miss Hannigan in Annie, Doris Day was to replace her in an unmade movie of The West Side Waltz, and - most intriguingly - she dropped out of Jerry Lewis&rsquo;s The Ladies Man (1961), in a role (later recast, then cut) that might have made Hollywood beckon.",

Loudon\'s letters from the road to her friend and housesitter Arthur Gorton offer a remarkably detailed and witty chronicle of clashing egos, unresponsive audiences, and other travails of living out of a trunk. </p>",
