(On Broadway, the cast consisted of Anne Jackson, Eli Wallach, and Alan Arkin, under the direction of Mike Nichols, who had worked with Loudon in nightclubs and on live television.)  Loudon\'s letters from the road to her friend and housesitter Arthur Gorton offer a remarkably detailed and witty chronicle of clashing egos, unresponsive audiences, and other travails of living out of a trunk. </p>",
