<p>Dorothy Loudon (1925-2003) was a singer, comedienne and Tony Award-winning actress, who appeared in supper clubs, television shows, films, summer stock and on Broadway. She was born on September 25, 1925 in Boston, Massachusetts and grew up and attended high school in Claremont, New Hampshire. Her mother was a pianist, and her grandmother taught speech and drama at a private school in New England. </p>

<p>After attending Syracuse University, Loudon worked in summer stock and on the national nightclub circuit for several years. She moved to Manhattan in the early 1950s, and worked as a nightclub singer, eventually headlining at such clubs as Jimmy Ryan's on 52nd Street, The Blue Angel and the Persian Room of the Plaza Hotel. She sang with Louis Armstrong and toured in concert with Ray Bolger and George Burns. Loudon honed her skills as a comedienne under the guidance of cabaret entrepreneur Julius Monk.</p>

		<p>Loudon made her first appearance on the legitimate stage in the 1962 Off-Broadway production of <span class="titleLink">The World of Jules Feiffer</span>, directed by Mike Nichols. Her first Broadway show was the 1962 musical <span class="titleLink">Nowhere to Go but Up</span>, which was directed by Sidney Lumet and only ran for a week, but Loudon won a Theatre World Award for her performance. Later the same year Loudon garnered more attention for her debut on television's <span class="titleLink">The Garry Moore Show</span>, where whe was a regular for two seasons (1962-1964).</p>

		<p>Loudon continued to be well-received in unsuccessful shows. She earned her first Tony nomination for her performance in the 1969 musical, <span class="titleLink">The Fig Leaves are Falling</span>, directed by George Abbott. In 1971, she played the mother of the title character in <span class="titleLink">Lolita, My Love</span>, a musical version of the famous Nabokov novel, written by Alan Jay Lerner and John Barry, which closed out of town. She also appeared on Broadway in short-lived revivals of the plays <span class="titleLink">Three Men on a Horse</span> (1969) and <span class="titleLink">The Women</span> (1973).</p>

	<div class="span-14 append-1">
		<p>Loudon's big break came in 1977 when her campy performance as Miss Hannigan in the 1977 blockbuster <span class="titleLink">Annie</span>, garnered her Tony, Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle awards for best performance by an actress in a musical and catapulted her to stardom. This was followed by Michael Bennett's <span class="titleLink">Ballroom</span>, for which she received a Tony Award nomination. In 1980 she was chosen to succeed Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Lovett in Stephen Sondheim's Tony Award-winning musical <span class="titleLink">Sweeney Todd</span>. In 1985 she co-starred with Chita Rivera and Leslie Uggams in <span class="titleLink">Jerry's Girls</span>, a revue of Jerry Herman songs. Loudon also played Parthy in the Chicago engagement of Harold Prince's 1996 revival of Kern and Hammerstein's <span class="titleLink">Show Boat</span>.</p>

		<p>Throughout her career, she continued to appear in straight plays as well as musicals. In 1981 Loudon co-starred with Katharine Hepburn in <span class="titleLink">The West Side Waltz</span> on Broadway and on tour and had another smash hit in Michael Frayn's farce <span class="titleLink">Noises Off</span> (1983.) Loudon starred in the national companies of <span class="titleLink">Driving Miss Daisy</span> (1989) and <span class="titleLink">The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds</span> (1981.) In 1991 she played Dolly Levi in an off-Broadway revival of Thornton Wilder's <span class="titleLink">The Matchmaker</span>. Her final Broadway appearance would have been as Carlotta Vance in the 2002 Lincoln Center Theater revival of <span class="titleLink">Dinner at Eight</span>, but medical problems forced her to withdraw from the show during previews.</p>
