<p>Dorothy Loudon (1925-2003) was a singer, comedienne and Tony Award-winning actress, who appeared in supper clubs, television shows, films, summer stock and on Broadway. She was born on September 25, 1925 in Boston, Massachusetts and grew up and attended high school in Claremont, New Hampshire. Her mother was a pianist, and her grandmother taught speech and drama at a private school in New England. </p>

<p>After attending Syracuse University, Loudon worked in summer stock and on the national nightclub circuit for several years. She moved to Manhattan in the early 1950s, and worked as a nightclub singer, eventually headlining at such clubs as Jimmy Ryan's on 52nd Street, The Blue Angel and the Persian Room of the Plaza Hotel. She sang with Louis Armstrong and toured in concert with Ray Bolger and George Burns. Loudon honed her skills as a comedienne under the guidance of cabaret entrepreneur Julius Monk.</p>

		<p>Loudon's big break came in 1977 when her campy performance as Miss Hannigan in the 1977 blockbuster <span class="titleLink">Annie</span>, garnered her Tony, Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle awards for best performance by an actress in a musical and catapulted her to stardom. This was followed by Michael Bennett's <span class="titleLink">Ballroom</span>, for which she received a Tony Award nomination. In 1980 she was chosen to succeed Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Lovett in Stephen Sondheim's Tony Award-winning musical <span class="titleLink">Sweeney Todd</span>.

Loudon also played Parthy in the Chicago engagement of Harold Prince's 1996 revival of Kern and Hammerstein's <span class="titleLink">Show Boat</span>.</p>

		<p>Throughout her career, she continued to appear in straight plays as well as musicals. In 1981 Loudon co-starred with Katharine Hepburn in <span class="titleLink">The West Side Waltz</span> on Broadway and on tour and had another smash hit in Michael Frayn's farce <span class="titleLink">Noises Off</span> (1983.) Loudon starred in the national companies of <span class="titleLink">Driving Miss Daisy</span> (1989) and <span class="titleLink">The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds</span> (1981.)
